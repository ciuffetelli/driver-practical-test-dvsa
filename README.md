## About

After struggling for months to secure a practical test booking for my wife, I had an idea. As a JavaScript developer, I realized that I could use my skills to find a solution through coding.

I'm sure many of you can relate to the difficulty of finding an available slot, especially with all the recent news. It's a frustrating process that requires endless hours of staring at a computer screen and hoping for the best.

That's why I came up with a solution: a Chrome extension that automatically refreshes the page and alerts you when a spot becomes available. Of course, you'll still need to act quickly to secure the booking, but I can personally guarantee that this method is more effective than spending three months manually searching for an opening.

Where you can learn how to install it and see how it works. Give it a try and let me know about your experience!

## Installation

Find on this page the button "Code" in green color and click on it. Then click on "Download ZIP". After that, unzip the file and open the folder. In the folder, you will find the file " driver-practical-test-dvsa.crx" inside of the folder "build". Drag and drop the file into the Chrome browser and click on "Add extension".

## Usage

This entering the DVSA booking page, you will be caring for the book as usual. When you get to the page where you select the date and time, the extension will start to work. It will automatically refresh the page every 1 minute and will alert you when a slot becomes available. You will hear a sound and a notification will appear on the screen. After this moment doesn't will refresh again until you click to search again.
